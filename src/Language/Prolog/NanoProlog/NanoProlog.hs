-- * The Prolog machinery
-- The result type contains a search tree, where the branches represent an application of a rule, and the 
-- leaves successful results. Successes are  represented by their corresponding substitution.
-- A branch is represented by the tag used to label the rule that was applied, by the rule that was applied, 
-- and by the ``continution'' of the search.
